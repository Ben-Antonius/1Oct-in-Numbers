## INTRODUCTION:

The following document I am presenting to you is a small statistical study about the actions of the security forces during the day of the referendum, the 1st of October of 2017.

The idea arose a few days after the consultation.

Facing numerous pieces of information that I received about small villages that were intervened in one form or the other by the police, I could not avoid asking myself in what measure these villages were affected than other larger ones.

I have looked for information on these places that any news of existed on what happened that day.

I can guarantee that all places that appear in this writing are sufficiently documented (in fact, I have attached in all case in which that was possible, links that prove that each of these places suffered a police intervention. In the cases only a simple writing in a newspaper appeared, I called the town hall, to confirm the facts (which I specify in this writing). 

I have to clarify that by police intervention, I do not necessarily mean a charge. I’ve included in this listing all places where the National police, or the Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) presented themselves with the objective to avoid the referendum. In this way, we have the case of Argentona, where the Guardia Civil went, but the presented themselves on the outskirts of the village in an industrial area because that’s where they believed the polling stations of that village to be. In this case however, like in many others, there were no incidents because when realising they were mistaken, the simply left.

What I’m trying to make clear is that I‘m interested in the places that were chosen, not in what happened. And I’m interested in that because there were so many small places that were affected by these types of situations.

I would also like to clarify that in the listing you see below, I’ve included data on services that might or might not be available in these villages. The existence or not of a municipal police, health-care centres, Catalan police stations and fire brigades (this information is available by region (comarca)). The motivation behind including this information is simple, I believed it to be interesting, not only to talk about the number of inhabitants of these villages or cities, but to also visualise the degree of lack of protection many of the inhabitants found themselves with.

I believe it is not the same, however crude they were, the actions that were suffered by the larger cities like Barcelona, Sabadell, Girona, etc. than the ones in places like La Cabra del Camp, Mont.roig and others. In the first cities, the fact that firemen, Catalan police (Mossos d’Esquadra) or sanitary staff were present, converts these places in less vulnerable than the others. Obviously, that does not mean that on a humane level, it should not be believed that certain actions of the police where more justified in one place than in another.

Also, I would like to say that some of the villages I’ve not been able to find. I hope they are not a lot, but in any way I am quite convinced that if so, they would be part of the group of smaller villages. If any information reaches me about any missing places, I will add them. 

In any way, because they would be relatively small, they would increase the percentage of small villages affected by police actions.
Finally, I will add any census data and strength of local police forces that have been extracted from the Catalan Institute for Statistics and which you can find using these links:

## Summary:

I have counted 55 places affected, with a total of 106 police actions. Looking at the statistical tables, it’s surprising to see that 25.5% of the places intervened where of less than 500 inhabitants, 60% in places of less than 2000 and 70.88% in villages of less than 4000 inhabitants.

If we look in relation to the interventions, obviously this percentage is lower because in Barcelona only, there were a total of 28 police interventions.
Equally, the percentage of small or medium sized places that were affected is very large (39% of less than 4000 and 39.95% of less than 8000 inhabitants).

With these numbers in mind it’s impossible not to ask yourself why the state’s (Spain) pretence was to stop a referendum would invest that much effort and resources in intervening villages in which the number of votes would be , by force, pretty insignificant for the total outcome.

What sense did it make to go to Renau (148 inhabitants), Campins (470 inhabitants), Estaràs (163 inhabitants) or others slightly larger, when trying to achieve the referendum to be declared invalid? Obviously, the official answer to these questions, we will never know, but it is inevitable asking if the real motive was to stop the popular vote or something else.


## Personal Note:

The 1st of October, as many other Catalan citizens, I was protecting one of the polling stations. I was at Escola Teresa Claramunt in Sabadell. During that day, emotionally very charged, a few things shocked me. The first was the attack to the school Escola Nostra Llar (also in Sabadell), performed by the Spanish National Police. The second when, via WhatsApp, I started receiving Audio files and videos of different places all around Catalonia where similar things happened. 

I am remembering now, specifically, the audio file, shared by the mayor of Fonollosa (Bages) in which he explained the things that happened there. Iw as surprised (maybe I am too naïve and did not expect this) that the agents of the Guardia Civil (Spanish Civil guard) presented themselves in villages that small. What would they win in places like this? But the truth is that the thoughts that came to mind, when this information reached me is that these must be much unprotected places. And that the difference between my city, Sabadell and Fonollose for example is that in the school Escola Nostre Llar, such an amount of people joined that managed to push back the Policia Nacional (Spanish National Police) without achieving their objective. In Fonollosa nevertheless, they did not have any opportunity of stopping anything, there are only 251 inhabitants. 
A quite well known case is that of the Escola Industrial in Barcelona, where 2000 citizens stopped the police from even entering the school. Also, it has to be added that in places like Sabadell, Barcelona, Taragona and others, it’s clear that medical attention could be provided almost immediately in many cases. This as opposed to the majority of really small villages, where they only have one small local medical office, which opens a day a week. Honestly it shrank my hart when thinking about these places where the presence of Firemen, Mossos (Local Catalan Police) or doctors is not possible, Police presented themselves ready to attack the civilians that guarded the polling stations.
